      <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

      <h4>About a time I was blocked on a simple problem</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>What was the problem?</strong>
        <br />
        Just this week I was stuck on the gradebook exercise around the
        enterScores() function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What problem-solving techniques did I use?</strong>
        <br />

        Tried just about everything I could think of - ultimately, I ended up
        asking in discord for the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How did I feel throughout the process?</strong>
        <br />

        Annoyed
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What did I learn?</strong>
        <br />

        I often misunderstand questions/instructions, so I need to be better at
        asking for clarification.
      </p>
      <h4>About a time I elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
      <p>
        Not sure if this qualifies as elegant but it was a simple and cost
        effective solution
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What was the problem?</strong>
        <br />
        Fear of dogs
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What problem-solving techniques did I use?</strong>
        <br />

        Try something - Let boarder get a dog
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How did I feel throughout the process?</strong>
        <br />

        Anxious, Nervous
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What did I learn?</strong>
        <br />

        Things are never as bad as they seem in your mind.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
        <br />
        5/10 - Understand the concept, however it doesn't feel completely
        natural using this method yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Trying something</strong>
        <br />

        10/10 - this usually my first go to.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>
        <br />

        10/10 - Only if I'm the duck, I will often talk to myself if I'm working
        on a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reading error messages</strong>
        <br />

        7/10 - sometimes error messages don't exactly spell out the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Console.logging</strong>
        <br />

        o 7/10 - definitely getting better at this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Googling</strong>
        <br />

        10/10 - this is my second stop if I can't figure it out for myself after
        a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
        <br />

        3/10 - haven't really done this
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>
        <br />

        6/10 - have been doing this a bit more lately.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I'm almost always reluctant to ask for help - there is a satisfaction to
        figuring something out for yourself so I will often explore this avenue
        last. However as things have been progressing in this course and it's
        entering into stuff that's new to me and things are going to become more
        time sensitive I'll need to forego the pursuit of satisfaction in the
        interest of asking for help sooner.
