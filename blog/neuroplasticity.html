      <h2><strong>Research Neuroplasticity</strong></h2>
      <h4>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Understanding what neuroplasticity provides benefits to people via
        altering an awareness of how their brains operate. The idea is that your
        brain is able to be 'shaped' and/or 're-shaped' meaning that no matter
        where you are in life your current set of skills/knowledge is not set in
        stone but rather clay...it's only set for now - just waiting for a bit
        of water and some effort and you're ready to re-shape in new ways.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.
      </h4>
      <p>
        I find practice to be a powerful tool, I also like the idea of taking it
        one step further with a 'use it and improve it' approach meaning to
        apply these principles to things that I want to focus on rather than
        things that don't necessarily need to be mastered.
      </p>
      <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Video games! (It feels like I've lived my whole life for this moment!)
        </li>
        <li>Learn a new language.</li>
        <li>Make music.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I think as long as you are working towards a learning
        orientated goal you're on the right track
      </p>

      <h2><strong>Research Growth Mindset</strong></h2>
      <h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h4>
      <p>
        It's the belief that a person's skills or abilities can grow over time.
        It is relevant because it effectively replaces the idea of failure with
        the idea of a learning opportunity.
      </p>
      <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
      <p>
        Not particularly I have touched base on this stuff before in some
        management courses I have done.
      </p>
      <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
      <p>Whenever I have attempted to do something there are 4 outcomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't try and succeed = feels great!</li>
        <li>Don't try and don't succeed = impartial</li>
        <li>Try and succeed = feels good</li>
        <li>Try and don't succeed = sucks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Problem is that last one doesn't feel too great, so adopting a growth
        mindset here is helpful (provided you're open to feedback) as it
        reframes the shortfall as an opportunity to discover where I went wrong
        so I can apply the learnings to the next attempt.
      </p>

      <h2><strong>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</strong></h2>
      <h4>
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The key takeaways I found here are practice, practice, practice and to
        recognise learning opportunities. I found the neuroplasticity stuff to
        be quite important for me as quite often I can learn about something,
        even to the point of understanding it but usually in the short term
        rather than the long term.
