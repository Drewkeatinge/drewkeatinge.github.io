        <h2>Margin, Border, and Padding</h2>

        <h4><strong>What's the difference?</strong></h4>

        <p>
          When I think about Margin, Borders and Padding, I think about swimming
          pools.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help illustrate my analogy I have made up this image below
          labelling each part with what represents what.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/swimming-pool.png" alt="image of swimming pool" />

        <h3>Padding</h3>
        <p>
          The padding is like the area around the pool where you can walk
          around, or put a deck chair & tables etc it's the space between the
          element (in this case the pool) and the border (the fence)
        </p>

        <h3>Border</h3>

        <p>
          The border here is represented by the fence, - this is the boundry of
          the element and is what sperates it from other elements. Just as the
          walls of the pool hold the water, the border is the walls that hold
          the element.
        </p>

        <h3>Margin</h3>

        <p>
          This is the area around the element, it's the space between the border
          and other elements. in this example it would be the distance you walk
          from your house to your swimming pool.
