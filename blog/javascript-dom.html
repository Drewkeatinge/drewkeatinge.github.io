      <h2>Javascript DOM</h2>
      <h4>First of all, What is it?</h4>
      <p>
        Javascript is a programming language that we can use to manipulate
        webpages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Module) is an interface that allows content on
        a webpage to be created or changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For examples the Header and menus on this page are all created using
        Javascript
      </p>
      <h4>How does it all work?</h4>
      <p>
        Javascript uses a sort of naming convention to find and target the
        building block of a website - we call these names classes and/or ids.
        Using these 'names' we can ask the relative blocks to behave in certain
        ways.
      </p>
      <h4>How might you interact with it?</h4>
      <p>
        The best way I feel I can explain is it try and imagine a school
        assembly where each student represents a website buiding block, each row
        of students represents an object (in this scenario it would be an array)
        and the entire hall represents the DOM. The principal represents
        Javascript and the Principals words represent functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each student has a name, i.e. Harold, this name is representative of
        their 'id'.
      </p>
      <h4>Functions</h4>
      <p>
        If the principal was to say "Stand up Harold" this would be Javascript
        calling a function. These instructions target Harold by his 'id' and ask
        him to change his state from sitting to standing.
      </p>
      <p>This could be respresented like this</p>
      <img src="../images/standup-single.png" />
      <h4>Loops</h4>
      <p>
        If the principal then wanted to they could ask every student in the row
        to do the same thing. This is called a loop as it would go through each
        student one by one until the end of the row. Lets say it's a row with
        the 'class' of Row-A
      </p>
      <p>This could be represented like this</p>
      <img src="../images/stand-row.png" />
      <h4>Control Flow</h4>
      <p>
        This would be similar to an assembly agenda, basically means the order
        of things starting at the top and working towards the bottom (generally)
      </p>
      <h4>Arrays vs Objects</h4>
      <p>
        Arrays store data in a singular type fashion i.e (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), you
        can access this information by referencing the sequance location whereas
        an object stores things as key-value pairs i.e {PE:Ball, Math:Ruler}. To
        access the value you need to first address the key.
      </p>
      <h4>Javascript in relation to HTML & CSS</h4>
      <p>
        Best way I can describe this is with a set of drawers. HTML is what the
        drawers are made of and also what each draw contains. CSS is how the
        drawers look and feel. Javascript is the action of opening and or
        closing the drawers.
