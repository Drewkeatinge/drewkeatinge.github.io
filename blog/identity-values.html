        <h2>Identity, Values & Strengths</h2>

        <h4>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h4>

        <p>
          I’m not sure how to answer this, I’m not sure I make many ethical
          decisions? Or if I do, perhaps I’m unaware that’s what they are. I
          usually just make decisions and proceed with them unless I’m
          challenged by someone or second guess myself.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h4>
        <p>
          My work has been my culture for most of my life, I’m not terribly
          close with my family, nor am I especially social or have a lot of
          friends. The biggest influence on me was probably my first boss, he
          was the first person to give me an opportunity and took me under his
          wing. I wouldn’t be where I am today without his path crossing mine
          and even now, I still try to emulate what he taught me in my own life.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h4>

        <p>
          I learn quick – if it’s interesting, I have years of problem-solving
          experience. I think these skills will support my learning journey as I
          can probably take on the workload without feeling too stressed out
          (hopefully!).
        </p>

        <h4>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h4>

        <p>
          I’m currently pretty stuck career wise, hence why I have enrolled in
          Dev academy. I’ve had a predominantly retail based background and I’ve
          gone about as far as I can go without having to get back into people
          management.
        </p>

        <h4>
          5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h4>

        <p>
          This happens pretty constantly in any work place I would imagine, over
          the year’s I’ve found that I work more effectively as a seed planter
          rather than a motivator. I achieve the results I’m after by making the
          people who matter think things are their idea.
