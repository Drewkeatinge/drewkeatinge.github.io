      <h2>Foundations Reflections</h2>
      <h4>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h4>
      <p>1. I started off a little to confident in my abilities</p>
      <p>2. Simplifying coding problems so far is a weakness</p>
      <p>
        3. Not getting it right it fine, as long as it's a foundation to build
        on
      </p>

      <h4>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h4>
      <p>
        They are key elements to create a successful synergenic workplace when
        working with people who may work/approach things differently to you
      </p>

      <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        Not a lot, I have covered a bit of this content over the course of my
        career so far - particularly in the management roles I've had
      </p>

      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        Deciding how honest to be I suppose, I can drown in pessimism if I don't
        catch myself
      </p>

      <h4>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Same answer as question 2. Technical skills will help get your foot in
        the door but attitute will help take you all the way
      </p>

      <h4>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h4>
      <p>
        No, it doesn't feel like a waste of time. It's important as it will help
        with success when it ultimately becomes time to enter the workplace
