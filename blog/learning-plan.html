        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>

        <p>
          I work closely with a couple of developers in my job currently but
          their time given to us is limited which stagnates some the the things
          I am trying to acheive. Ultimately I would like to be able to take
          over from them and do the delelopment on our website myself.
        </p>

        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>

        <p>
          Strenths are I usually learn quick, sometimes I've gotta wait for that
          lightbulb moment but it eventually comes. Limitations is mainly time -
          it would be great if there were twice as many hours in a day.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>

        <p>Learning to be more confident would be great</p>

        <h4>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h4>

        <p>
          I will treat all other people I come across as professionals as if I
          have met them in the workplace. If things get to a point where the
          workload is becoming overwhelming then I will apply to take a few days
          leave from work and use that time to get things back under control.
        </p>

        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>

        <p>Just to be there if I or anyone else needs help really.</p>

        <h4>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h4>

        <p>
          Work is the only thing I need to think about really. 7am till 6pm each
          day including travel time. Some aspects of my job are quite mind
          numbing and I've found that these times are doubling up as study
          reflection.
