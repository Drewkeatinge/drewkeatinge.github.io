        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>

        <p>
          I work closely with a couple of developers in my job currently but
          their time given to us is limited which stagnates some the the things
          I am trying to acheive. Ultimately I would like to be able to take
          over from them and do the delelopment on our website myself.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </h4>

        <p>
          Strengths are I usually learn quick, biggest limitation will be tying everything together - that lightbulb hasn't turned on yet but I know that will continued practice it will.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </h4>

        <p>Rebuilding confidence, working in groups</p>

        <h4>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>

        <p>
          1. Team work via distance, there are some elements of an in person team that just can't be replicated easily via virtual environments.
        </p>
        <p>2. Making sure I am able to keep up with everyone else</p>

        <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>

        <p>Same as foundations really - Just to be there if I or anyone else needs help really.</p>

        <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
        <p>Keep focused, do the work, elimiate distractions as much as possible</p>

        <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h4>
        <p>I will treat all other people I come across as professionals as if I have met them in the workplace. 
          If things get to a point where the workload is becoming overwhelming then I will apply to take a few days 
          leave from work and use that time to get things back under control.</p>



        <h4>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h4>

        <p>
          Work is the only thing I need to think about really. 7am till 6pm each
          day including travel time. Some aspects of my job are quite mind
          numbing and I've found that these times are doubling up as study
          reflection.
