      <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>

      <p>
        EQ is different to IQ in that EQ refers to one's emotional intelligence
        such as the ability to be self-aware of your own emotions or be aware of
        what emotions others may be feeling. IQ refers to cognitive abilities
        such as technical skills, analytical thinking or knowledge retention.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>

      <p>
        EQ is important as it helps you to get a long with others, which is
        kinda what civilization is built on huh! 
        
        <p>In a workplace environment, if you are in a leadership role it is 
          important to work on your EQ skills as it will help you become a 
          more effective leader and have your staff be much happier in the 
          workplace.
        </p>

        <p>  
        I have experienced both leaders with
        great EQ skills and leaders that have virtually none. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>
        Leader 1 - great EQ skills 
        </h4>
        <p>
        This particular leader wasn't always around all of the time,
        but that didn't matter because it felt like he was because he was there
        when it mattered. He knew every staff member by name and would make a
        point of saying hello to you every day. If you had a problem, you felt
        like you could go to him and not feel like you were annoying or
        anything. He would also take a chance on you, meaning that if there was
        an aspect of the business that you were interested in, he would actually
        make a plan to help you learn the skills for the role. He had an
        approach that even if you learned the skills and decided to leave, then
        it was a feather in his cap as he was helping to put more talented
        people out into the world. Obviously, like anyone he had his flaws, for
        example he probably gave people a few more chances than they deserved
        but overall he was fantastic to work for, so much so that when he moved
        on to a new business on the other side of the country, multiple people
        were happy to pack up and move with him to continue working for him.
        </p>
        
        <h4>
        Leader 2 - no EQ skills 
        </h4>

        <p>
        This guy was horrendous to work for. He was
        there nearly every minute of every day and rather than add value by
        being there he would subtract value with his presence. He was hugely
        unapproachable if you had a problem in the workplace and if you did need
        to talk you needed to book in an appointment outside of your rostered
        hours because 'he was paying you to do a job not to complain'. After a
        while I found myself having no respect for him as a leader (which
        interestingly gave me a surprising amount of confidence when needing to
        deal with him). This business had a huge staff turnover rate because no
        one wanted to work there. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The contrast between these two 'bosses' is
        almost black and white. I can tell you with absolute certainty how
        important having a leader with developed EQ skills is.
